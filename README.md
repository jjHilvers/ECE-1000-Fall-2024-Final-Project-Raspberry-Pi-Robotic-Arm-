# ECE-1000 Raspberry Pi Robotic Arm
This Github contains all relevant files used during the development of our robotic arm project for ECE 1000

## Project Summary
For our ECE 1000 class, we were given a few options on what our final project could be. After a short discussion my partner and I chose to create a robotic arm since we felt it would best follow the path we want to follow with our majors. The robotic arm can move 180 degrees and pick up objects.

## Who Are We?
